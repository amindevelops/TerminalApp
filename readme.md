# Working on the CSS

1. I realised that normalize is actually different from 'reset' because it does in fact have some default styles of its own, that may differ from the browser. However, because I want to make sure my work is consistent across browsers and has factored in things like usability, I will start using normalize.css. #decision

2. The coding style to use often is based on the size of the project. If you overdo the arrangement of your code, you might over-engineer a solution that should have taken you far less time. Howver, you need to identify when you must refactor your code to be neater or more akin to best practice.

# Difficulties

1. Doubt what you been told?
- self-study
- research
- ask peers/colleagues
- employer/seniors
- public forums
- ask friends/family
- ask the person who started it all

# Resolutions

1. As a developer, I will develop myself first.
- Knowing how the root cause of an error may actually be the way you remember things or the way you think about it. The mistake was waiting to happen already, and if you didn't make it today, you would have made it another day. The key thing is to not make it again.
- I know that if I cannot improve my problem solving skills, I cannot improve my coding skills. However, I also know that to improve my problem solving skills, I must get better at solving ALL problems in life in general.

2. I was stuck because... but I then tried ... but that didn't work because ... then I just wanted a break.
