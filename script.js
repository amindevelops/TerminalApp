function hitEnter() {

function userInput(text) {
  // 1. Split the string
  // 2. Add logic based on the order
  // - command
  // Hint: simply string recognition code to identify a command (string match)
  // - each command must process flags and values
  // (that is also based on an order)
  // The order will always be, -flag value -flag value
  // Hint: Use functions to organise each task that your code does
  //
}

function commandBuy(flags_values) {
  //Break down the array further
}

//Objectives:
//1. Learn the coding styles/rules/nomenclature etc (e.g. -flag, -g for output beautifiers [mysql db]) for command line interfaces (CLI)
//2. Instead of memorising a bash cheatsheet, learn it while you create your own terminal app
//3. Explore programming principles
//4. Opportunity to build YOUR OWN TOOL
//5. "I built my own console application to speed up my own workflows, in and out of work"
//6. Successes and Challenges
// - Employer workflow improvements / barriers
// --- Console App OR Employer tool e.g. Bitrix, Zapier

//HTML
//on keypress enter to trigger function
//Or implement that javascript

//Javascript
//Strings and comparisons
//String operations e.g. explode, split
//Arrays and access
//FileReader API

//LocalStorage
//1. Just in case the code breaks whilst running, you might encounter one of two scenarios:
// a) partially written data to the file
// b) no data saved to file
//LOST OR CORRUPT data
//Options:
//a) Create a queue locally on the user's device, which is then processed.
//b) 


//Stretch
//1. Add a status icon on the app to indicate connectivity strength or presence
//2. Sync animation or something to indicate to the user when a cloud-sync is taking place between local storage and the server-side
//3. In that respect, for good UX, you should have an indicator as well to clarify if you are up-to-date with the cloud or there is a local backlog.
